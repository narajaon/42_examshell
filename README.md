Every lvl 5 exercices that passes the moulinette

Some notes for each of them :
- brackets : pretty straightforward, you declare an in array that you fill with the open brackets and as soon as you encounter a closed one, you check backward

- itoa_base : as simple, you just need to pay attention to some unique cases like 0

- print_memory : the tricky part is to get the "remaining" of the memory (when the columns aren't full)

- rpn_calc : just be organized, the "hard" part about this one is the error handling
